# React Simple Calendar

`react-simple-calendar` is a headless calendar component built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI primitives.  
It ships a single `Calendar` component that includes **month**, **week** and **day** views, cursor-aligned popovers, and fake data generation for demos.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-simple-calendar
# or
yarn add react-simple-calendar
```

`react-simple-calendar` has two peer dependencies – `react` and `react-dom` (v18.2+). Everything else is bundled for you.

## Tailwind/Shadcn prerequisites

The calendar relies on Shadcn's design tokens. Add the CSS variables to your global stylesheet (usually `src/index.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "tailwindcss-animate";

@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
/* copy the :root /.dark tokens generated by shadcn */
```

If you created your project with the Shadcn CLI you already have these tokens in place.  
Make sure the `tailwindcss-animate` plugin is enabled so that popover animations work as expected.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Calendar } from "react-simple-calendar";

const events = [
  {
    id: "1",
    title: "Project Planning",
    start: new Date("2025-06-10T09:30:00"),
    end: new Date("2025-06-10T11:00:00"),
    description: "Roadmap review with product + design",
    color: "#2563eb",
  },
];

export function MySchedule() {
  return (
    <div className="h-[700px] rounded-xl border">
      <Calendar events={events} defaultView="month" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `events` | `CalendarEvent[]` | `[]` | List of events with `start`, `end`, `title`, optional `description`/`color`. |
| `defaultView` | `"month" \| "week" \| "day"` | `"month"` | Initial view when the component mounts. |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Optional wrapper class. |

## Local development

This repository still ships the demo playground. You can iterate on the component and preview changes locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # demo playground at http://localhost:5173
npm run build:lib    # bundling step before publishing
```

Publishing to npm is as easy as `npm publish` once `npm run build:lib` finishes (it outputs files inside `dist/`).
